/**
 * The registration service is used and called by all inspectIT Agents. First, they have to call the
 * {@link #registerPlatformIdent(List, String)} method which returns a unique id for their JVM.
 * Afterwards, all sensor types (no matter if method- or platform-) are registered. Then they are
 * going to register all methods which are instrumented by that Agent. The last step is to map the
 * method sensor type to the instrumented method by calling the
 * {@link #addSensorTypeToMethod(long, long)} method.
 * <p>
 * All of this information will be persisted in the database. The returned values are basically
 * representing the index of the data in the db.
